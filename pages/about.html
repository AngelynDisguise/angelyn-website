    <p>
        I am a Filipina and a first-generation college student. 
        I am currently a sophomore majoring in computer science at George Mason University with an interest in 
        web development, software engineering, and human-computer interaction.
        Besides computing, I also have a passion for music and enjoy playing the piano/organ for my church.
        When I am not coding or studying, I am usually playing Genshin Impact or watching anime with my family 
        and friends.
