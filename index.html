                <p>I am a Filipina and a first-generation college student. </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently a senior majoring in computer science at George Mason University with an interest in 
                    web development, DevOps, software engineering, and human-computer interaction. 
                    I also enjoy learning about new languages and styles like functional programming that make development fun!
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Besides computing, I also have a passion for music and enjoy playing the piano/organ for my church.
                    When I am not coding or studying, I am usually playing Genshin Impact, Minecraft, or watching anime with my family 
                    and friends.
